CSS class

Repository made to remenber end increasing knowledge in CSS.

1) start_css
2) selectors
    We use this appointments when we like reference:
        . = class   (logo)
            = tag     (header)
        # = id      (footer)
        Considerations:
        id and tag, use one per type;
        class, use punctually, but without restriction
3) relationship
4) pseudoselectors
